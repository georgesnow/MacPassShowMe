# MacPassShowMe
AppleScript - (un)Hide MacPass and focus on search (best with FastScripts global keyboard shortcut)

FastScripts - https://red-sweater.com/fastscripts/

Simple Applescript to use with FastScripts. Allows the user with Fastscripts to assign 
a global keyboard shortcut just for MacPass that will Hide/Unhide the app and
when unhiding will put the focus in the search box for quick access to your database

You could also tweak it for another app and a different menu option of preference.
